Restrict WooCommerce products by country using geolocation. Control what customers can see and buy based on their location — per product or in bulk.

== Description ==

**Country Based Restrictions for WooCommerce** lets you control exactly which products are visible and purchasable based on your customer's country — using WooCommerce's built-in geolocation engine (MaxMind GeoIP2) for 99.5% accuracy.

Whether you're selling region-specific products, dealing with legal compliance restrictions, or managing international distribution agreements, CBR gives you precise control over your catalog by country — without any coding.

**HPOS Compatible** · **5,000+ Active Stores** · **Free & Open Source**

= What You Can Do =

* **Restrict products per country** — For any product, choose a list of countries to include (sell only to) or exclude (block from). Set it per product in seconds.
* **Three visibility modes** — Choose how restricted products behave for blocked customers:
  * Hide completely from shop, search, and category pages
  * Hide from shop and search but allow direct URL access
  * Keep visible but non-purchasable (show with a custom message instead of Add to Cart)
* **Include or exclude rules** — For each product, choose whether the country list means "sell only to these countries" or "do not sell to these countries".
* **Works with WooCommerce Geolocation** — Uses the shipping country the customer enters, falling back to WooCommerce Geolocation (MaxMind GeoIP2) when no shipping country is set yet.
* **Supports product variations** — Apply country restrictions to individual variations within a variable product, not just the whole product.
* **HPOS Compatible** — Fully compatible with WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage (custom order tables).
* **Translation ready** — Fully translatable via standard WordPress/WooCommerce translation tools.

= How It Works =

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Go to **WooCommerce > Shipment Tracking > Country Restrictions** to configure the default visibility settings.
3. Open any product and set the country restriction rule — choose include or exclude, and select the countries.
4. Customers visiting from a restricted country will see the product according to your chosen visibility mode.

= Free vs PRO — What's the Difference? =

CBR Free gives you per-product country restrictions. CBR PRO adds bulk tools, payment gateway control, and advanced display options for stores managing restrictions at scale.

**CBR Free includes:**

* Per-product country restriction rules (include or exclude)
* Three visibility modes: hide completely, hide from shop/search, or show but block purchase
* Variation-level restrictions
* WooCommerce Geolocation detection (MaxMind GeoIP2)
* HPOS compatible

**CBR PRO adds:**

* **Bulk restrictions by category, tag, attribute, or shipping class** — Apply rules to entire product groups at once instead of editing each product individually.
* **Global restriction rules** — Apply one rule across all products sitewide.
* **Bulk CSV import** — Import country rules for hundreds of products at once.
* **Disable payment gateways by country** — Hide or disable specific payment methods (PayPal, Stripe, etc.) for customers from restricted countries.
* **Hide product prices by country** — Show the product but hide the price for restricted countries.
* **Country detection widget** — Let customers manually change their detected country from the storefront.
* **Custom restriction messages** — Set a custom message per product shown to restricted customers instead of the Add to Cart button.
* **Redirect restricted customers** — Redirect blocked visitors to a custom page instead of showing an error.
* **Remove bulk rules** — Clear single-product rules in bulk via the product list bulk actions.
* **Priority support** — Faster, dedicated assistance from the Zorem team.

⚠️ **Important note for caching:** Caching plugins (WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, SiteGround Optimizer) and CDNs can serve cached pages that bypass geolocation detection. Ensure your caching is configured to exclude geolocation cookies and country detection from the cache. [See the documentation](https://docs.zorem.com/docs/country-based-restrictions-pro/) for setup guidance.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin detect a customer's country? =

CBR uses WooCommerce's built-in country detection. It checks the shipping country the customer enters during checkout first. If no shipping country has been set yet, it falls back to WooCommerce Geolocation (MaxMind GeoIP2), which has 99.5% country-level accuracy.

= Can I restrict a product so only customers from specific countries can buy it? =

Yes. On any product page, set the restriction rule to "Include" and select the countries that are allowed to purchase. Customers from all other countries will see the product according to your chosen visibility mode (hidden, or visible but not purchasable).

= Can I block specific countries from buying a product? =

Yes. Set the restriction rule to "Exclude" and select the countries to block. Customers from those countries will be restricted; everyone else can purchase normally.

= What happens to restricted customers — do they see the product? =

You choose. Three visibility modes are available: hide the product completely from shop and search; hide from shop and search but allow direct URL access; or keep the product visible but replace the Add to Cart button with a custom message.

= Can I restrict individual product variations by country? =

Yes. CBR supports variation-level restrictions, so you can allow some variations to be purchased in certain countries while restricting others within the same variable product.

= Can I restrict products in bulk by category or tag? =

Bulk restrictions by category, tag, attribute, shipping class, or globally (all products) are available in [CBR PRO](https://www.zorem.com/product/country-based-restriction-pro/).

= Can I restrict payment gateways by country? =

Disabling specific payment gateways for customers from restricted countries is available in [CBR PRO](https://www.zorem.com/product/country-based-restriction-pro/).

= Can I hide product prices for restricted countries? =

Hiding the product price for restricted countries is available in [CBR PRO](https://www.zorem.com/product/country-based-restriction-pro/).

= Does CBR work with WPML or Polylang multilingual stores? =

Yes. CBR is compatible with WPML and Polylang. Country rules set on a product apply across all language versions of that product.

= Will caching plugins interfere with country detection? =

Yes — this is a common issue. If your caching plugin serves a cached page, the geolocation check may not run for that visitor. You need to configure your caching plugin to exclude pages with geolocation cookies from the cache. See the [documentation](https://docs.zorem.com/docs/country-based-restrictions-pro/) for specific instructions per caching plugin.

= Does CBR work with HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage)? =

Yes. CBR is fully compatible with WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage (custom order tables).

= Does CBR work with WooCommerce Subscriptions? =

Yes. CBR supports WooCommerce Subscriptions, including variation-level restrictions on subscription products.
